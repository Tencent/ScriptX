//
// Because python's bad support of sub-interpreter, here to manage GIL & thread state manually.
// - One engine owns a sub-interpreter, and owns a TLS storage called engine.subThreadState_, 
// which stores his own current thread state on each thread.
// - This "thread state" works like "CPU Context" in low-level C programs. When changing engine, 
// "context" need to be changed to his correct thread state
// - When entering a new EngineScope, first check that if an thread state exists. If found,
// save it into oldThreadStateStack. When exit this EngineScope, old thread state saved before
// will be poped and recovered.
// - GIL is locked when any EngineScope is entered, and it is a global state (which means that 
// this lock is shared by all threads). When the last EngineScope exited, the GIL will be released.
// 
// GIL keeps at one time only one engine can be running and this fucking situation is caused by 
// bad design of CPython. Hope that GIL will be removed in next versions and sub-interpreter support
// will be public. Only that can save us from managing these annoying things manually
